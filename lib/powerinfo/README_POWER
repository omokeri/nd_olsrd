POWER STATUS PLUGIN FOR OLSRD
by Andreas Tønnesen(andreto@olsr.org)

ABOUT

The olsrd power status plugin is ment to be a easy
to understand example of how one can write custom
plugins for the UniK olsr daemon.

It gathers powerifno from the local node by polling
the /proc/apm pseudofile. So to diffuse powerinfo
about a node it needs to have APM enabled.
All powerinfo is gathered in a database and you
can wiev the output by telneting to 127.0.0.1
port 8888 on the local machine.

Feel free to use this as a framework for new 
plugins! That's what it is intended to be used for.

PORTABILITY

The plugin compiles for GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and
win32, but the APM interface only works on APM/ACPI 
enabled GNU/Linux systems. But since this plugin
is ment to be a startingpoint for new plugins, it
has been "ported" to the other OSes.

WHAT IS IT?

This code compiles as a dynamic loadable library -
known as so files in Linux and DLL in windows.
The code is loaded by olsrd at runtime and the
plugin can use certain functionality offered
by olsrd.
It is very usefull when adding custom packettypes
but it could be used for a variety of purposes.
